# Vanila Weather App

A vanilla weather project is a simple weather application built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It utilizes weather data from a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to display the current weather conditions for a specific location.

The project typically involves the following steps:

Setting up the project structure and files (e.g., index.html, script.js, and style.css).
Fetching the user's weather coordinates using the weather API.
Sending a request to the weather API using the obtained coordinates or the city name.
Handling the API response and extracting relevant weather data such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
Updating the DOM to display the retrieved weather information, including the weather icon.
Adding styles and layout to enhance the visual presentation of the weather app.
